                    <p>Here’s how you can become a part of the Kairox family:<br/><br/>

                    <h1 className="text-lg">1. Explore</h1><br/>
                    Begin by exploring our vision, curriculum, student life, and campus features through virtual or physical open days.

                    <br/><br/><h1 className="text-lg">2. Submit Your Application</h1><br/>
                    Complete a short application form that helps us understand your interests, strengths, and aspirations.

                    <br/><br/><h1 className="text-lg">3. Create & Express</h1><br/>
                    We ask all applicants to submit a Personal Expression Project — this could be a video, art piece, essay, prototype, or even a digital creation that reflects who you are and what excites you about the future.

                    <br/><br/><h1 className="text-lg">4. Interview & Discovery Dialogue</h1><br/>
                    Selected applicants are invited to a one-on-one conversation with a member of our Futures Faculty. This is more of a shared dialogue than an interview — designed to explore your dreams and potential fit with Kairox.

                    <br/><br/><h1 className="text-lg">5. Decision & Welcome</h1><br/>
                    Offers are extended based not on grades alone, but on attitude, creativity, and mission-alignment. Admitted students receive a Kairox Welcome Kit, and a personalized onboarding journey begins.</p>
